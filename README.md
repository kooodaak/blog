# 🛡️ Security, QA & Code — My Tech Notes

Welcome!  
This is my little corner on the internet where I write about:

- Penetration testing
- QA and software quality
- Programming, tools, and workflows
- Bugs I’ve found (and what I learned from them)

## 👋 About Me

I’m a developer focused on **penetration testing**, **QA**, and **software quality**.  
I like breaking things in a controlled, responsible way — and then helping fix them.

- 🛡 Penetration Testing (mostly apps & web)
- ✅ QA mindset: test, verify, break, repeat
- 💻 Coding to automate boring stuff and improve testing

I believe in:
> "Find the bug before the user does."

## 📝 What I Write About

- Real-world security issues (sanitized and anonymized)
- Checklists and tips for QA and testing
- Tools, scripts, and techniques I use daily
